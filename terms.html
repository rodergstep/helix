              <p>At HELIX RE, Inc. (HELIX), we are committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information. This Privacy Policy is to let you know what information we use and collect from users of www.helix.re and other HELIX URLs and websites (collectively,
                the “Sites”), the HELIX software platform (“HELIX Platform”), any of our services (“Services”), and on behalf of our clients. The Sites and the HELIX Platform shall be included in the definition of Services for purposes of this Privacy
                Policy.</p>
              <p>This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information that is processed by HELIX in the course of offering and operating the Services. This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into the HELIX Terms of Service (“the “Terms”). By using
                our Sites or Services, you expressly agree to HELIX’s collection, storage, use, processing and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
              <p>E.U. GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION</p>
              <p>HELIX is investing time and energy to comply with the EU GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (“GDPR”) as set forth by the Council of the European Union and European Parliament, which becomes enforceable May 25, 2018, regarding the collection,
                use, transmission, processing, and retention of personal identifiable data of natural persons from European Union member countries. The GDPR is meant to strengthen the security and protection of personal data and to harmonize data protection
                laws throughout the EU.</p>
              <p>What this means is that we at HELIX are committed to protecting your data in a secure and transparent manner. HELIX processes, uses, and exchanges personal data for our legitimate business purposes only in the limited uses described herein.
                </p>
              <p>The HELIX Platform only requires basic personal information from our users, such as name and email address, to facilitate user management, usage monitoring and provide our Services. Such data is stored in the HELIX Platform infrastructure
                and may in the future be shared with limited external vendors to the extent necessary to provide HELIX’s Services. HELIX does not use personal information for any purpose outside of providing the Services as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
              <p>privacy@helix.re. For more information, see “Rights of Access, Rectification, Erasure and Restriction” below.</p>

                to automatically collect information through the Services. We may use technologies that are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices that allow us to record certain pieces of information
                whenever you visit or interact with our Sites, Services, applications, and to recognize you across devices. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Services may not work properly. We also use third
                party analytics such as Google Analytics to gather and analyze aggregated anonymous user information. For more information about Google Analytics, please visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. You can opt out of Google’s collection

              <p>THIRD PARTY SITES AND SERVICES</p>
              <p>The Services may contain links to other websites and other websites may reference or link to our Site or other Services. These other domains and websites are not controlled by us, and HELIX does not endorse or make any representations about
                third-party websites, services or social media platforms. We encourage our users to read the privacy policies of each and every website and application with which they interact. We do not endorse, screen or approve, and are not responsible
                for the privacy practices or content of such other websites or applications. Visiting these other websites or applications is at your own risk.</p>
              <p>In addition, third parties may directly gather anonymous user information from users of our Sites through automated means such as cookies. For example, companies who place ads on our Sites may set their own cookies or use other automated
                mechanisms that gather anonymous user information. This Privacy Policy does not cover how third parties gather and use such data.</p>
              <p>RIGHTS OF ACCESS, RECTIFICATION, ERASURE AND RESTRICTION</p>
              <p>You may inquire as to whether HELIX is processing personal information about you, request access to personal information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your personal information where it is inaccurate. Where otherwise permitted
                by applicable law, you may send an e-mail to privacy@helix.com or use any of the methods set out in this Privacy Policy to request access to, receive (port), seek rectification, or request erasure of personal information held about you
                by HELIX. Please include your full name, email address associated with your Account, and a detailed description of your data request. Such requests will be processed in line with local laws.</p>
              <p>Although HELIX makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their personal information, there may be circumstances in which HELIX is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains
                legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy in the case in question, where the request
                is manifestly unfounded or excessive, or where it is commercially proprietary. If HELIX determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been
                made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, HELIX will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your personal information.</p>
              <p>DATA RETENTION</p>
              <p>HELIX retains the personal information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Services, resolve disputes, establish
                legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws. </p>
              <p>SECURITY</p>
              <p>We take your security seriously and take reasonable steps to protect and secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure, including through secure sockets layer, password protection and, for certain transmissions
                to our Services, encryption. Any information collected by HELIX is stored on servers that HELIX manages, using standard security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information. Although we take reasonable security
                measures to protect your personal information, please be aware that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, HELIX cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit
                on or through the Sites or Services and you do so at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Services. </p>
              <p>CHILDREN’S DATA</p>
              <p>The Services are not directed to children under 16 years of age, and HELIX does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16 years of age. If you learn that your child has provided us with personal information without
                your consent, you may alert us at privacy@helix.com. If we learn that we have collected any personal information from children under 16 years old, we will promptly take steps to delete such information.</p>
