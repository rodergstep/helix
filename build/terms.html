                  AND COMPLY WITH THESE TERMS. IF AT ANY TIME YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY TERMINATE YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.</p>
                <p>These Terms provide that all disputes between you and HELIX will be resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT TO ASSERT OR DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THIS CONTRACT (except for matters that may be taken

                  damages, injuries, liabilities, costs, fees and expenses (including, but not limited to, legal and accounting fees) arising from or in any way related to (i) your use or misuse of the Services (including your use or misuse of Third Party
                  Content); (ii) your breach or other violation of these Terms, including any representations, warranties, or covenants herein; or (iii) your violation of the rights of any other person or entity. HELIX reserves the right, at your expense,
                  to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims. You may not settle any matter without the prior written consent of HELIX.
                  HELIX will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.</p>
                <p>Disclaimers. THE SERVICES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE HELIX PLATFORM, THE HELIX APPS, HELIX CONTENT, AND ANY OTHER PRODUCT, SERVICE OR INFORMATION PROVIDED BY HELIX), THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, AND ANY OTHER SOFTWARE, SERVICES OR APPLICATIONS
                  MADE AVAILABLE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OR THROUGH THE SERVICES, ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS”, “AS AVAILABLE”, “WITH ALL FAULTS” BASIS WITHOUT REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT
                  NOT LIMITED TO, IN TERMS OF CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, SECURITY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE.</p>
                <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, HELIX AND ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, AND SUPPLIERS HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY,
                  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES, THE HELIX CONTENT, HELIX APPS, AND ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, INFORMATION, OR CONTENT PROVIDED BY ANY OTHER THIRD
                  PARTY. HELIX AND ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, AND SUPPLIERS DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES OR ANY PART THEREOF, OR ANY HELIX CONTENT OR HELIX APPS, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND DO
                  NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THE FOREGOING WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING THE SERVICES, HELIX, OR HELIX’S AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, OR
                  SUPPLIERS, THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS.</p>
                <p>Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT WILL HELIX, ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, OR SUPPLIERS, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS, BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
                  OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICES, ANY HELIX CONTENT OR HELIX APPS, OR ANY INFORMATION OR CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION,
                  OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER BASED IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF HELIX OR ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, OR SUPPLIERS ARE EXPRESSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL HELIX, ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS,
                  OR SUPPLIERS, OR ANY OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING, BE LIABLE IN THE AGGREGATE FOR ANY DAMAGES INCURRED GREATER THAN ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100) FOR ALL CLAIMS UNDER ANY OF THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE.
                  Limitations; Basis of the Bargain. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW FOR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH CASES, YOU AGREE
                  THAT BECAUSE SUCH WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN YOU AND HELIX, AND ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND HELIX, THE LIABILITY
                  OF HELIX AND ITS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT HELIX WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OFFER THE SERVICES TO YOU ON AN ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE BASIS WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.</p>
                <p>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and HELIX (or HELIX’s affiliates, as applicable) in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and HELIX, (or HELIX’s affiliates, as
                  applicable) agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge
                  or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes,
                  but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during
                  or after the termination of these Terms. You understand and agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and HELIX (or HELIX’s affiliates, as applicable) are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</p>
                <p>Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection (A), we both agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions
                  through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims. </p>
                <p>Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and HELIX (or HELIX’s affiliates, as applicable) will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures (“AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these
                  Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting HELIX.</p>
                <p>Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on
                  file for you, by electronic mail (“Notice”). HELIX’s address for Notice is: 72E 3rd Avenue San Mateo, CA 94401. The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”).
                  We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or HELIX (or HELIX’s affiliates, as applicable) may commence an arbitration
                  proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or HELIX (or HELIX’s affiliates, as applicable) shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award,
                  if any; provided that if our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, HELIX (or HELIX’s affiliates, as applicable) shall pay you the greater of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, and (ii) the greatest
                  amount offered by HELIX (or HELIX’s affiliates, as applicable) in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award. Fees. In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, HELIX (or HELIX’s affiliates,
                  as applicable) will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at
                  a location to be agreed upon in Santa Clara County, California, USA, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator,
                  through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought
                  for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse HELIX (or HELIX’s affiliates,
                  as applicable)for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision
                  sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time
                  during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
                <p>No class actions. YOU AND HELIX (OR HELIX’S AFFILIATES, AS APPLICABLE) AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
                  PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and HELIX agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. Modifications. In
                  the event that HELIX makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the HELIX’s address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to HELIX’s address
                  for Notice, in which case your account with HELIX shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, shall survive.</p>
                <p>Enforceability. If only Subsection (F) of this Section 17 or the entirety of this Section 17 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 17 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive
                  jurisdiction and venue described elsewhere in Section 18 shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>
                <p>Governing Law; Venue. These Terms, whether interpreted in a court of law or in arbitration, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California as they apply to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California
                  by California residents, and without regard to conflict of law principles. To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted hereunder, you and HELIX agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state
                  courts and federal courts located within the County of Santa Mateo, California for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes. Notices. HELIX may provide you with notices by mail, electronic mail, or postings on the Services.
                  You may provide HELIX with notices by United States Registered Mail sent to HELIX RE, Inc. at 72E 3rd Avenue San Mateo, CA 94401. If notice is provided by electronic mail, notice will be deemed given twenty-four hours after electronic
                  mail is sent, unless HELIX is notified that the electronic mail address is invalid. If notice is provided by posting on or through the Services, then notice will be deemed given upon such posting. Alternatively, we may give you legal
                  notice by mail to a postal address, if provided by you through the Services. In such case, notice will be deemed given three days after the date of mailing.</p>
                <p>Miscellaneous. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and HELIX relating to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede all previous communications, representations, understandings and agreements, either oral or written,
                  between you and HELIX with respect to said subject matter. These Terms shall not be modified or waived except in a writing signed by both parties, or by a change to these Terms as provided in Section 10 (“Modification of the Terms”),
                  above. In the event any of the provisions of these Terms are held unenforceable or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provisions shall be deemed severed, and the remaining provisions thereof shall remain in full force
                  and effect. The failure of HELIX to enforce, in any one or more instances, any of the provisions herein shall not be construed as a waiver of the prior or future performance of any such terms or conditions. You agree that no joint venture,
                  partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and HELIX as a result of these Terms or use of the Services. The Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but
                  may be assigned by HELIX without restriction, including by operation of law, merger, reincorporation, recapitalization, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets to which these Terms pertain. Any assignment attempted to be made
                  in violation of these Terms shall be void. The headings and captions in these Terms are used for convenience only and are not to be considered in interpreting these Terms. The services hereunder are offered by:</p>
